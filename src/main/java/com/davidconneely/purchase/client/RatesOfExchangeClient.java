/**
 * Reading the
 * <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange#dataset-properties">Data Dictionary</a>,
 * it seems `effective_date` is the correct field to use for conversion, not `record_date`.
 * <p>
 * A new record with the same `record_date` but a later `effective_date` can be added to a quarter if the currency
 * shifts by more than 10% within a quarter, and that new `exchange_rate` should be used from the `effective_date`.
 * <p>
 * There's actually less than 20,000 records in the data-set, so we can easily cache them in memory even if the
 * records were 1 kB each (they are probably just a few 100 bytes each, so will easily fit in less than 10 MB).
 * <p>
 * Note that the API limits the response data size to 10,000 records in a single REST call. Also, data is only ever
 * added to either the current quarter (same `record_date`, but new `effective_date`), or to the new quarter when a
 * new quarter begins.
 * <p>
 * So a valid caching strategy would be to cache everything and just check for new changes since the last quarter or
 * later once a day.
